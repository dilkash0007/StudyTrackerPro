Track Your Study is a comprehensive study tracking application built with React and backed by both Supabase (for authentication and data storage) and MongoDB (for additional server-side functionalities). The app features:
User authentication (login/signup) with both email/password and Google sign-in
Dashboard with study statistics and task management
Pomodoro timer for focused study sessions
Calendar view for scheduling and tracking
Book/PDF management and viewing
Statistics and progress tracking
Flashcard functionality
Notes management
Community and leaderboard features
User profile and settings
Potential Improvements and Optimizations
1. Database Architecture
Mixed Database Technologies: The app uses both Supabase and MongoDB which adds complexity. Consider consolidating to one database technology for easier maintenance.
Offline Functionality: There appears to be some offline support, but it could be enhanced with a more robust offline-first approach using IndexedDB or Service Workers.
2. Performance Optimizations
Bundle Size: The large component files (many 10KB+) suggest potential code splitting opportunities to reduce initial load time.
Component Optimization: Many components like DashboardContainer.js contain complex animation logic that could be optimized or extracted.
Lazy Loading: While the app uses React.lazy for route-based code splitting, additional component-level lazy loading could improve initial load performance.
3. Code Structure
Duplicate Context Files: There are both context/ and contexts/ directories which may cause confusion.
Large Component Files: Many components exceed 300-400 lines, making maintenance challenging. Consider breaking them into smaller, focused components.
API Abstraction: The Supabase API calls could be better abstracted into dedicated service modules for easier testing and maintenance.
4. State Management
Context Overuse: The app relies heavily on React Context for state management. For complex state, consider Redux or Zustand.
Network State: Implement better handling of loading/error states when fetching data from APIs.
5. Testing
Minimal Testing: Limited test files found. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for core functionality.
6. UX Improvements
Responsive Design: Verify that all components work well across different screen sizes.
Accessibility: Add ARIA attributes and ensure proper keyboard navigation for accessibility compliance.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
7. DevOps
Environment Configuration: Consolidate environment variables and configuration management.
Deployment Pipeline: Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
8. Security Enhancements
Secure Authentication: Ensure proper JWT handling and refresh token mechanisms.
Data Protection: Implement proper client-side data encryption for sensitive information.
API Security: Add rate limiting and request validation on the server side.
9. Documentation
Code Documentation: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to improve code maintainability.
User Documentation: Create detailed user guides for application features.
10. Modern React Practices
Custom Hooks: Extract more reusable logic into custom hooks.
Use More Modern React Patterns: Consider implementing more render props, compound components, and other modern React patterns.}
